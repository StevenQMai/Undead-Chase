## How to Play

Your goal is to survive waves of zombies while collecting power-ups to restore health. Zombies and the boundary of the game will damage you upon contact. The game ends when your health reaches zero. As time passes, more zombies will spawn, with each zombie having a random speed value when spawned. Zombies will not despawn.

## Controls
The basic controls are:

• W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys for movement

## Game Features
• **Health System:** Start with a base health of 300. Zombies and boundaries reduce health, while power-ups restore it.

• **Zombies:** Randomly spawning zombies will chase you, and they bounce off the screen edges.

• **Power-Ups:** Medkits spawn to restore health, allowing you to survive longer.

• **Score System:** Track the time you’ve survived.

• **Dynamic Difficulty:** Zombies will continue to spawn indefinitely as you play.

• **Hurt System:** Visual cues show when the hero takes damage from zombies or hitting the screen boundaries.
